## lsd-account functions ##

#' Calculate credit, debit, and current value of an account
#'
#' Calculate the total credit, debit, and the current value of a given account
#' in the form of pounds, shillings, and pence.
#'
#' `deb_account()` is similar to [deb_account_summary()], but
#' it only returns the information for one account instead of all accounts in
#' the credit and/or debit variables of a transactions data frame.
#'
#' `deb_account()` is part of a family of functions meant to be used on
#' data frames that contain transactions between accounts likely contained in
#' an account book. The data frame should possess a similar structure to a
#' [directed edge list](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/network-analysis-with-r/#nodes-edges).
#' In this context, credit and debit variables filled with the ids of the
#' accounts act as the edges of the network. Following the
#' [nomenclature of accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits),
#' the credit variable represents the account from which a value goes out,
#' while the debit variable represents the account that receives the value.
#' Thus, from the credit account to the debit account.
#'
#' `deb_account()` uses the nomenclature of
#' [l, s, and d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Â£sd) to represent pounds,
#' shillings, and pence, which derives from the Latin terms
#' [libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre),
#' [solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)), and
#' [denarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius). In the 8th century a
#' solidus came to represent 12 denarii, and 240 denarii were made from one
#' libra or pound of silver. The custom of counting coins in dozens (solidi)
#' and scores of dozens (libra) spread throughout the Carolingian Empire and
#' became engrained in much of Europe. However,
#' [other ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency) between
#' libra, solidus, and denarius were also in use. The `lsd_bases` argument
#' makes it possible to specify alternative bases for the solidus and denarius
#' values.
#'
#' @family lsd account functions
#' @param df A data frame containing transactions between accounts that has
#'   values represented in the form of pounds, shillings, and pence variables.
#'   The data frame should have two variables for accounts (credit and debit)
#'   and variables for pounds, shillings, and pence.
#' @inheritParams deb_normalize_df
#' @param account_id The id of the account to be used to calculate the credit,
#'   debit, and current values. The value for the account should be present in
#'   the credit and/or debit variables.
#' @param credit credit column: Unquoted name of the credit variable. This is
#'   the column from which the value of the transaction is from. Default
#'   is credit. The credit column must be of the same class as the debit
#'   column.
#' @param debit debit column: Unquoted name of the debit variable. This is
#'   the column to which the value of the transaction goes. Default
#'   is debit. The debit column must be of the same class as the credit
#'   column.
#'
#' @return Returns a data frame with three rows and four columns. The rows
#'   correspond to credit, debit, and current values in the form of
#'   pounds, shillings, and pence. The names for the pounds, shillings,
#'   and pence columns correspond to the input for `l`, `s`,
#'   and `d`.

#' Calculate the balance of a transactions data frame
#'
#' Calculate the balance remaining on `df` in the form of pounds,
#' shillings, and pence. This shows the total credit and debit remaining
#' on the transactions data frame or account book.
#'
#' `deb_balance()` is based on [deb_open()]. The function adds the credits
#' and debits of the accounts that remain open to calculate the capital
#' remaining in the transactions data frame. The values for credit and debit
#' should be the same, as each credit also has a corresponding debit.
#'
#' `deb_balance()` is part of a family of functions meant to be used on
#' data frames that contain transactions between accounts likely contained in
#' an account book. The data frame should possess a similar structure to a
#' [directed edge list](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/network-analysis-with-r/#nodes-edges).
#' In this context, credit and debit variables filled with the ids of the
#' accounts act as the edges of the network. Following the
#' [nomenclature of accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits),
#' the credit variable represents the account from which a value goes out,
#' while the debit variable represents the account that receives the value.
#' Thus, from the credit account to the debit account.
#'
#' @family lsd account functions
#'
#' @inheritParams deb_account_summary
#'
#' @return Returns a tibble with two rows showing the credit and debit
#'   remaining in `df` in the form of pounds, shillings, and pence.
#'   The names for the pounds, shillings, and pence columns correspond to
#'   the input for `l`, `s`, and `d`.
