\title{Convert from pounds, shillings and pence to pounds}
\usage{
deb_lsd_l_mutate(df, l = l, s = s, d = d, column_name = librae,
  lsd_bases = c(20, 12))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame that contains pounds, shillings, and pence variables.}

\item{l}{Pounds column: Unquoted name of a numeric variable corresponding
to pounds. Default is l.}

\item{s}{Shillings column: Unquoted name of numeric variable corresponding
to shillings. Default is s.}

\item{d}{Pence column: Unquoted name of numeric variable corresponding to
pence. Default is d.}

\item{column_name}{Unquoted name of the column for the decimalized pounds.
Default is \code{pounds}.}

\item{lsd_bases}{Numeric vector of length 2 used to specify the bases for
the s or solidus and d or denarius values in the lsd variables. Default is
\code{c(20, 12)}, which conforms to the most widely used system of 1 libra =
20 solidi and 1 solidus = 12 denarii. This argument makes it possible to
use alternative bases for the solidus and denarius values that were also
in use.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with a new decimalized pounds variable.
}
\description{
Convert pounds, shillings, and pence variables in a data frame to a
decimalized pounds variable.

\examples{
# Create a new decimalized pounds variable
example <- data.frame(l = c(35, 10, 26, 12),
                      s = c(10, 18, 11, 16),
                      d = c(9, 11, 10, 5))
deb_lsd_l_mutate(example, l, s, d)

# Change the name of the decimlaized pounds variable
deb_lsd_l_mutate(example, l, s, d, column_name = pounds)
