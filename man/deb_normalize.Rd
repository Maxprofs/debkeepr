\title{Normalize pounds, shillings, and pence}
\usage{
deb_normalize(lsd, round = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{lsd}{Numeric vector of length 3 or list of numeric vectors of length
3. The first position of the vector represents the pounds value or l. The
second position represents the shillings value or s. And the third
position represents the pence value or d.}

\item{round}{Round pence to specified number of decimal places.
Default is 3. Set to 0 to return pence as whole numbers.}
}
\value{
Returns either a named numeric vector of length 3 or a list of
named numeric vectors representing the values of pounds, shillings,
and pence. If the input lsd value is negative, the l, s, and d values
will all be negative.
}
\description{
Normalize pounds, shillings, and pence to the correct values based
on 12 pence in a shilling and 20 shillings in a pound.
}
\details{
This function uses the nomenclature of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Â£sd}{l, s, and d} to refer to pounds,
shillings, and pence. This derives from the Latin terms for librae,
solidi, and denarii. One solidus was equivalent to 12 denarii, and
240 denarii coins were made from on libra of silver. The nomenclature
and values of 12 denarii to 1 solidus and 20 solidi to 1 libra were adopted
by at least the 8th century and spread throughout Europe through the
Carolingian Empire.

\examples{
# Use to calculate the correct number of pounds, shillings, and pence
deb_normalize(lsd = c(5, 55, 22))

# It is possible to perform math within the function
deb_normalize(lsd = c(5 + 6, 20 + 18, 8 + 11))

# deb_normalize can deal with negative values
deb_normalize(lsd = c(-5, -25, -22))

# Or a mixture of positive and negative values
# if that occurs for some reason
deb_normalize(lsd = c(5, -25, 22))

# deb_normalize can also properly normalize decimalized pounds and shillings
deb_normalize(lsd = c(8.7, 33.65, 15))

# Use the round argument to return whole pence
deb_normalize(lsd = c(8.7, 33.65, 15), round = 0)

# To normalize multiple lsd values use a list of lsd vectors
lsd_list <- list(c(4, 34, 89), c(-9, -75, -19), c(15.85, 36.15, 56))
deb_normalize(lsd = lsd_list)
