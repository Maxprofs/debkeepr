\title{Convert from decimalized shillings to pounds, shillings, and pence}
\usage{
deb_s_lsd(s, round = 3, vector = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Shillings: numeric value}

\item{round}{round pence to specified number of decimal places. Default is 3.
Set to 0 if you want pence to always be a whole number.}

\item{vector}{Logical (default FALSE), when FALSE the output will
be a tibble, when TRUE the output will be a numeric vector.}
}
\value{
Returns either a tibble with one row of values and columns for the
pounds, shillings, and pence values labeled as l, s, and d or a named
numeric vector with values for pounds, shillings, and pence. If s
is negative, the pounds, shillings, and pence values will all be negative.
}
\description{

and pence. The function returns the value from a decimal currency to the
non-decimal currency of pounds, shillings, and pence.
This is a wrapper around \code{deb_refactor()}.
}
\examples{
# Pounds, shillings, and pence as a tibble
deb_s_lsd(s = 2635)

# Pounds, shillings, and pence as named vector
deb_s_lsd(s = 2635, vector = TRUE)

# The value for shillings can be negative
deb_d_lsd(-2635)

# Or it can have a decimal
deb_d_lsd(2635.835)
