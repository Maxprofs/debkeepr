\title{Convert from decimalized pounds to pounds, shillings, and pence}
\usage{
deb_l_lsd(l, round = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{l}{Decimalized pounds: numeric vector representing pounds to be
converted into an lsd value.}

\item{round}{Round pence to specified number of decimal places.
Default is 3. Set to 0 to return pence as whole numbers.}
}
\value{
Returns either a named numeric vector of length 3 or a list of
named numeric vectors representing the values of pounds, shillings,
and pence. If the input lsd value is negative, the l, s, and d values
will all be negative.
}
\description{
Convert decimalized pounds to the lsd system of pounds, shillings,
and pence. The function returns the value from a decimal currency to the
non-decimal currency of pounds, shillings, and pence.
This is a wrapper around \code{\link[=deb_normalize]{deb_normalize()}}.
}
\examples{
# Conversion from pounds to pounds, shillings, and pence
# only make sense with decimalized pounds.
deb_l_lsd(l = 8.625)

# The value can be negative
deb_l_lsd(l = -8.625)

# l can be a vector of length > 1
# Return a list of lsd vectors
deb_l_lsd(l = c(8.625, -8.625, 8))
