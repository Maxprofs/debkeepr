\usage{
deb_account_summary(df, credit = credit, debit = debit, l = l, s = s,
  d = d, round = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing transactions between accounts that has
values represented in the form of pounds, shillings, and pence variables.
The data frame should have two variables for accounts (credit and debit)
and variables for pounds, shillings, and pence.}

\item{credit}{credit column: Unquoted name of the credit variable. This is
the column from which the value of the transaction is from. Default
is credit. The credit column must be of the same class as the debit
column.}

\item{debit}{debit column: Unquoted name of the debit variable. This is
the column to which the value of the transaction goes. Default
is debit. The debit column must be of the same class as the credit
column.}

\item{l}{Pounds column: Unquoted name of a numeric variable corresponding
to pounds. Default is l.}

\item{s}{Shillings column: Unquoted name of numeric variable corresponding
to shillings. Default is s.}

\item{d}{Pence column: Unquoted name of numeric variable corresponding to
pence. Default is d.}

\item{round}{round pence to specified number of decimal places.
Default is 3. Set to 0 if you want pence to always be a whole number.}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble with five columns and three rows for each account
present in the credit and/or debit variables of \code{df}. This
represents the total credit, debit, and current values of the accounts
in the form of pounds, shillings, and pence. The names for the pounds,
shillings, and pence columns correspond to the input for \code{l},
\code{s}, and \code{d}.
}
\description{
Calculate the total credit, debit, and the current values in the form of
pounds, shillings, and pence for all accounts in \code{df}. Credits and
debits are both returned as positive numbers. If an account has more
credits than debits, the current value will be returned as positive
numbers. If the debits are greater, the current value will be returned
as negative numbers.
}
\details{
\code{deb_account_summary()} is similar to \code{\link{deb_account()}}, but
it returns the information for all accounts in a transaction data frame
instead of one. If you only want to see the current values for each account,
see \code{\link{deb_current}}.

\code{deb_account_summary()} is part of a family of functions meant to be used on
data frames that contain transactions between accounts likely contained in
an account book. The data frame should possess a similar structure to a
\href{https://www.jessesadler.com/post/network-analysis-with-r/#nodes-edges}{directed edge list}.
In this context, credit and debit variables filled with the ids of the
accounts act as the edges of the network. Following the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits}{nomenclature of accounting},
the credit variable represents the account from which a value goes out,
while the debit variable represents the account that receives the value.
Thus, from the credit account to the debit account.

The value for the transactions should be in the non-decimal currency of
pounds, shillings, and pence. These functions use the nomenclature of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Â£sd}{l, s, and d} to refer to pounds,
shillings, and pence. This derives from the Latin terms for librae,
solidi, and denarii. One solidus was equivalent to 12 denarii, and
240 denarii coins were made from on libra of silver. The nomenclature
and values of 12 denarii to 1 solidus and 20 solidi to 1 libra was
adopted by Charlemagne and spread throughout Europe under different names.
