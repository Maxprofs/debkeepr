\title{Normalize pounds, shillings, and pence variables in a data frame}
\usage{
deb_normalize_df(df, l = l, s = s, d = d, bases = c(20, 12),
  replace = TRUE, suffix = ".1")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame that contains pounds, shillings, and pence variables.}

\item{l}{Pounds column: Unquoted name of a numeric variable corresponding
to pounds. Default is l.}

\item{s}{Shillings column: Unquoted name of numeric variable corresponding
to shillings. Default is s.}

\item{d}{Pence column: Unquoted name of numeric variable corresponding to
pence. Default is d.}

\item{bases}{Numeric vector of length 2 used to specify the bases for
the s or solidus and d or denarius values in the lsd variables. Default is
\code{c(20, 12)}, which conforms to the most widely used system of 1 libra =
20 solidi and 1 solidus = 12 denarii. This argument makes it possible to
use alternative bases for the solidus and denarius values that were also
in use.}

\item{replace}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}): when \code{TRUE} the new pounds,
shillings, and pence variables will replace the original ones.}

\item{suffix}{Suffix added to the column names for the pounds, shillings,
and pence columns to distinguish new variables from the original pounds,
shillings, and pence columns if \code{replace = FALSE}. Default is ".1".
Should be a character vector of length 1.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with normalized pounds, shillings, and pence,
variables.
}
\description{
Normalize pounds, shillings, and pence variables in a data frame to
to standard unit bases.

\details{
\code{deb_normalize_df()} uses the nomenclature of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Â£sd}{l, s, and d} to represent pounds,
shillings, and pence, which derives from the Latin terms
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre}{libra},
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)}{solidus}, and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius}{denarius}. In the 8th century a
solidus came to represent 12 denarii, and 240 denarii were made from one
libra or pound of silver. The custom of counting coins in dozens (solidi)
and scores of dozens (libra) spread throughout the Carolingian Empire and
became engrained in much of Europe. However,
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency}{other ratios} between
libra, solidus, and denarius were also in use. The \code{bases} argument
makes it possible to specify alternative bases for the solidus and denarius
values.

\examples{
# Data frame with pounds, shillings, and pence variables
example <- data.frame(l = c(35, -10, 26.725, 12),
                      s = c(50, -48, 311.85, 76),
                      d = c(89, -181, 70, 205))
# Normalize the values of pounds, shillings, and pence
deb_normalize_df(example, l = l, s = s, d = d)

# Normalize values with alternative bases for solidus and denarius
# For instance, following Dutch system of gulden, stuivers, and penningen
deb_normalize_df(example, l = l, s = s, d = d, bases = c(20, 16))
