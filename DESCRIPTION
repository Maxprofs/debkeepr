Description: `debkeepr` provides an interface for analyzing non-decimal currencies that
    use the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence. It includes
    functions to apply arithmetic and financial operations to single or multiple
    values and to analyze account books that use either single-entry bookkeeping
    or double-entry bookkeeping with the latter providing the name for
    `debkeepr`. The pounds, shillings, and pence system complicates even relatively
    simple arithmetic manipulations, as each unit has to be normalized or
    converted to the correct base. `debkeepr` does the work of applying
    arithmetic operations and normalizing the units to the correct bases.
