Description: This package provides functions to make it easier to work with
    and analyze non-decimal currencies and accounts that use non-decimal
    currencies. Specifically, it provides functions to work with the pounds,
    shillings, and pence system in which 12 pence (or denarii) are equivalent
    to 1 shilling (or solidus), and 20 shillings are equivalent to 1 pound (or
    libra) that has been widely used in Europe since the time of Charlemagne.
    debkeepr contains functions to work with single values or to help
    analyze an entire account book that uses double-entry bookkeeping.
