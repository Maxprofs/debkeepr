Description: `debkeepr` provides an interface for analyzing non-decimal
    currencies that use the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence.
    It includes functions to apply arithmetic and financial operations to
    single or multiple values and to analyze account books that use either
    single-entry bookkeeping or double-entry bookkeeping with the latter
    providing the name for `debkeepr`. The pounds, shillings, and pence system
    complicates even relatively simple arithmetic manipulations, as each unit
    has to be normalized or converted to the correct base. `debkeepr` does the
    work of applying arithmetic operations and normalizing the units to the
    correct bases.
